description: an documentation update in case of any modification to the working project
---

After each prompt run, if that prompt is working towards any modification in the project, then:
- update the project's GEMINI.md (if exists) with the updated requirements
- update the project's PROJECT_HISTORY.md (if exists) with the exact codebase changes that the agent implements.
